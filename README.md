# gamejam

repository for the hand tremors game jam

here ae some instructions to get started!

accounts needed:

1.) make a github account
2.) download godot
3.) join the gamedevbois discord if you haven't
4.) optional - make a game jolt account and participate in the hand tremors game jam
5.) optional - download github desktop

github:
In github, collections of files are called a respository, they basically act as shared places for users to upload code!

what the funny buttons do (to the extend of my knowledge):
code - allows you to download code or link the respository to your local files if you have github desktop
add file - does what it do, through this you can change code in the respository (through uploading a file with the same name) or add new files

alternatively you can use the pencil icon to edit the respository but not recommended.

something something about branches but i only learnt this in 30 minutes so idk bout that lol

godot:
In godot, games are called projects. projects are folders full of assets and code that make the game run!
to open a game you must navigate to the project.godot file and open it with the godot exe program.

There are many things to learn about godot but to get you started, there are two types of files in godot: scenes and scripts

scenes are labelled .tscn, scenes act as a visual representation of the objects in the game.
Not recommended to edit with text since they are not exactly code. 
scenes are not exactly objects but more of a screen containing objects. (A main menu is a scene, level 1 is a seperate scene, then a level select, which it's own scene)

scripts are labelled .gd, they are scripts that are attached to each object that gives it a behavior. self explanatory. These are what you should edit with godot's inbuilt IDE.

The theme for the game jam is CHILLED, something icy i suppose, let it go amirite

by the way, it is fine if we cannot make a game in time, all that matters is that we have fun and learn :)
